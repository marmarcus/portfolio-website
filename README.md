# My Portfolio Website

The `main` branch contains the source code to my portfolio website.

This website has two primary functions:

- A display for my skills and projects
- To learn ReactJS and TypeScript

## Progression

I am initially beginning this project with minimal knowledge in React and TypeScript.

The repository will be used as a way to showcase my progress in learning these technologies.
